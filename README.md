##Details
The Tsu Helper script adds a bunch of tweaks to make your Tsu experience more user friendly.

###FFM (Friends and Followers Manager)
Take more control of your Friends and Followers, including Friend requests you have sent or received.

Find all the Friends you are also Following. You can then automatically Unfollow all Friends, as doing both is unnecessary and uses up your precious Follows.

Just visit your Friends, Followers or Following tabs on your Profile to display the "F&F Manager" link.

![FFM Header][ffm-header]
- Search for pending sent and received Friend Requests.
- Search for Friends you are also Following.
- Automatically Unfollow all Friends.
- Show all found entries and filter them.

![Correct Count][correct-count]
- Display the correct number of Friends, Followers or users Following you.

###Quick-Mention in comments and replies
Quick-Mention adds easy to use links to each comment or reply, which makes mentioning users a breeze!

Mention the user who's post you are replying to, or the user who's reply you are replying to.

![Quick-Mention for Comment][mention-comment]
- Simply hover over your profile picture and select the Quick-Mention button ("@ >").

Mention any user from the comments list to easily add their mention to your comment or reply.

![Quick-Mention for Reply][mention-reply]
- First select the comment or reply text input, then hover over the comment of the user you would like to mention and click the Quick-Mention button ("@ +").

###Auto-focus
Auto-focusing the correct input fields is a great help to speed up your posting, commenting and messaging.

- The post message input, so you can instantly start typing a post.

![Auto-Focus Title][auto-focus-title]
- The title input, when adding a title.
- The message recipient input, when writing a new message.
- The message text input, when answering a message.

###Basic posting content checks
When creating a new post, there are a few things to remember before clicking the "Post" button.

![Popup: Social Network Sharing Reminder][popup-social-networks]
- Popup warning when posting without sharing to your connected social network accounts.

![Popup: Mention or Hashtag Limits Exceeded][popup-mention-hashtag-limits]
- Popup warning when too many #hashtags or @mentions have been used. (Limit is 10 each)

###Make things easier for the eye
A few things are not so pleasent to look at and some things are difficult to see.
- Messages get displayed with correct line breaks to make them easier to read.

![Emphasize Nested Replies][nested-replies-parent]
- Comments with nested replies, the "Reply (n)" link is emphasized, to show there are nested replies.

###Open single posts easily
Opening single posts is easier than ever!

![Open Single Post][open-single-post]
- Just double click the header are of any post or share to open the single post itself.
- To open the single post in a new window or tab, hold down the "Shift" key while double clicking.

###Stay up to date!
Whenever a new update is available, you will be notified visually. The username link on the top right will get an orange background and a new menu item will appear allowing you to update easily.
